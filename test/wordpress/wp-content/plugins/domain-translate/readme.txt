== Description ==

Domain Translate is a WordPress Plugin what translates on the client browser the WordPress page. You can select in the WordPress Admin the Domain, the Source and the Target Language. There are 107 Languages available.
Currently, it's based on the Google Translate service. Because your visitor's browser translates the page, it's free for you as a WordPress site administrator. The downside of this browser-side translation approach is that search engine crawlers may not index the translated page.
