== How it Works ==

The plugin checks your domain and if its setup for a translation it injects the Google Translate JavaScript API into your WordPress website's frontend.
The Google Translate script intercepts the page's content and dynamically translates it in the user's browser.
This process happens client-side, meaning the original content on your server remains in its primary language,
and the translated version is rendered directly for the end-user.

== Installation ==

Download the plugin (if applicable, from the WordPress plugin repository or a provided ZIP file).
Upload the plugin to your WordPress installation via Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin or by uploading the unzipped folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
Configure the plugin settings (found under Settings > Domain-Translate ) to customize language and domain options.

== Usage ==

The translation is performed automatically by Google Translate based on your domain and language settings.

== Limitations ==

=== Machine Translation Accuracy ===

While Google Translate is highly advanced, machine translations may not always be perfectly accurate or contextually appropriate.
Human review for critical content is always recommended.

=== SEO Considerations ===

Since the translation happens client-side, search engines typically index only the original language content of your website.[
This plugin is primarily for user experience and accessibility, not for improving multilingual SEO.
For robust multilingual SEO, dedicated multilingual plugins that store translated content are generally preferred.
